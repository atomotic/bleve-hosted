# bleve-hosted

A general purpose application which can be used to host read-only access to one or more Bleve indexes.

## Why

For many smaller applications, you don't need to customize the server-side technology to host the index.  You can simply copy this template application, add your index to the `indexes/` folder and serve up read-only access to this index.

## Future work

- Dockerization
- Google App Engine Support
